## 设计思路

- 防杀：在苟住的前提下，打出伤害

## 模式选择

```dataview
TABLE
	效果, 箴言
from "mode"
sort isdone ASC
```

## 卡牌

```dataview
TABLE 
	Rarity AS "稀有度",
	Type AS "类型",
	Cost AS "费用",
	DESCRIPTION AS "描述",
	UPGRADE AS "升级"
from "card"
sort isdone ASC
```


## 能力

```dataview
TABLE 
	Type AS "类型",
	DESCRIPTION AS "效果"
from "power"
```


## 遗物

```dataview
TABLE 
	Rarity AS "稀有度",
	DESCRIPTION AS "效果"
from "relic"
```


## 怪物

```dataview
TABLE 
from "monster"
```
